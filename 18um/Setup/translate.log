NAME
          TIM-106 (Information) Converting capacitance units for
          library '%s' since those in library '%s' differ.

DESCRIPTION
          The capacitance units specified in the first library
          differ from those in the second library.  The second
          library is Design Compiler's "main" library and
          determines DC's default capacitance units.  DC reports
          will use these units and all capacitance values
          annotated on the design (using set_load) are assumed to
          be in these units.

          The informational message notifies you that Design
          Compiler is handling conversion of units so that delay
          calculation using cells in the first library will use
          capacitance values in its native units.

          Design Compiler's "main" library is determined as
          follows:  During reporting the main library is the
          first library in the link path that contains a cell
          that is used in the design.  During optimization the
          main library is the first target library specified.

WHAT NEXT
          To see the units that are specified for a library, use
          the report_lib command.
